Port 139 is for NetBIOS (Network Basic Input Output System). A software protocol that allows apps to communicate over LAN using network hardware. 

Port 445 is for SMB. A client-server protocol that regulates access to files shared from a Windows Machine. "A share".

The combination of these 2 ports indicate the usage of SMB. 

An SMB server can provide **arbitrary parts of its local file system as shares**. Therefore the **hierarchy visible** to a client is partially **independent** of the **structure** on the **server**. **Access rights** are defined by `Access Control Lists` (`ACL`). They can be controlled in a **fine-grained manner** based on attributes such as **`execute`**, **`read`**, and **`full access`** for individual users or user groups. The **ACLs** are defined **based on the shares** and therefore do not correspond to the rights assigned locally on the server.

```
1) smbmap -H IP

2) smbclient -L IP -U user

3) smbclient -L IP -N #NUll SESSION
```

Use Metasploit to pwn SMB.

Use ckackmapexec

```
ckackmapexec smb IP
```
